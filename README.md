[Zinit](https://github.com/z-shell/zinit) can use the NPM package registry
to automatically:

- get the plugin's Git repository OR release-package URL,
- get the list of the recommended ices for the plugin,
  - there can be multiple lists of ices,
  - the ice lists are stored in *profiles*; there's at least one profile, *default*,
  - the ices can be selectively overriden.

Example invocations that'll install
[aws/amazon-ecs-cli](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli):

```zsh
# Download the binary of amazon-ecs-cli command
zinit pack for ecs-cli

# Download the ecs-cli binary with use of the bin-gem-node annex
zinit pack"bgn" for ecs-cli
```

## Default Profile

Provides the CLI command `ecs-cli` by coping it to `$ZPFX/bin`.

The Zinit command executed will be equivalent to:

```zsh
zinit as=null id-as="ecs-cli" mv="*latest -> ecs-cli" \
    atclone='chmod +x *; cp -vf ecs-cli $ZPFX/bin' \
    atpull="%atclone" sbin="ecs-cli" is-snippet for \
        https://amazon-ecs-cli.s3.amazonaws.com/ecs-cli-${(M)OSTYPE#(linux|darwin)}-amd64-latest
```

## bin-gem-node Profile

Provides the CLI command `ecs-cli` by creating a forwarder script (a *shim*) in
`$ZPFX/bin` by using the
[bin-gem-node](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-bin-gem-node) annex. It's the best
method of providing the binary to the command line.

The Zinit command executed will be equivalent to:

```zsh
zinit as=null id-as="ecs-cli" mv="*latest -> ecs-cli" \
    atclone="chmod +x *"  atpull="%atclone" sbin="ecs-cli"
    is-snippet for \
        https://amazon-ecs-cli.s3.amazonaws.com/ecs-cli-${(M)OSTYPE#(linux|darwin)}-amd64-latest
```
